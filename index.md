This workshop is intended for researchers in genomics and related fields
with little to no experience with the command-line, large-scale computing,
or with computational genomics tools and workflows.
The topics covered will include: an introduction to the Linux command-line,
and introduction to large-scale computing and submitting jobs to a typical
high-performance computing resource,
running a typical raw data to
variant calling workflow for Illumina data, and
strategies for running the same workflow on multiple files in
parallel, to take advantage of the cluster architecture.

> ## Prerequisites
> Some knowledge of the Unix shell is desired, but not strictly necessary.
> Some knowledge of genetics is required; e.g., you should know what
> the terms "genome" and "mutation" refer to.
